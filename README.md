Counterforensic scripts in mostly python or powershell

These scripts are written purely to learn powershell and python and see the extent we can go. dont use these scripts for bad things! 
Im sure you are smarter than that.


1) ImageSkip.py - This script can be executed in any directory that has images and the images are then scrambled and will skip autopsy software checks
